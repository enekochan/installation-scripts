ARToolKit, Collada DOM, OpenSceneGraph and osgART for Ubuntu
------------------------------------------------------------

They are intended to work on multiple versions of Ubuntu from 10.04 to 12.04.
Still working on this though (testing in all versions takes time...).

Run in this order:

1.- installARToolKit.sh
2.- installCollada.sh
3.- installOpenSceneGraph.sh
4.- installosgART.sh

*******************
*ARToolKit Patches*
*******************

"VideoGStreamer.patch" fixes a problem with osgART that made it not displaying
the video feed on the background (the background was black).

I've created a new "artk-v4l2-2.72.1.20120613.patch" from "artk-v4l2-2.72.1.20101003.patch"
to fix a problem in util applications because some of them configured the
"vconf" variable with a constant value and thus didn't read the ARTOOLKIT_CONFIG
system variable.

"Freenect.patch" adds support for OpenKinect (via libfreenect) video feed. You'll
have to install libfreenect to make this work.

The patches that have "GST_LIBS" in their name fix the problem installing
ARToolKit in Ubuntu 11.10 and upper.


************************
*OpenSceneGraph Patches*
************************

Different patches to solve some FFmpeg compatibility issues in some Ubuntu versions.


****************
*osgART Patches*
****************

"osgART_Permissive.patch" solves a issue that forced using -fpermissive when configuring
"osgART_Cont.patch" gives the option to use a more smooth way of tracking the pattern
in ARToolKit (arGetTransMatCont instead of arGetTransMat).


OpenCV 2.4.2 with ffmpeg for Mac OS X 10.8
------------------------------------------

Just run the "installOpenCV-2.4.2-ffmpeg-OSX-ML.sh" script.

**************
*OpenCV Patch*
**************

"OpenCV-2.4.2-ffmpeg-OSX-ML.patch" patches the "modules/highgui/CMakeLists.txt"
file so it can correctly link lame and faac libraries with libopencv_highgui.
